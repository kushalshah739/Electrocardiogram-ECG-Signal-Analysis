# Electrocardiogram-ECG-Signal-Analysis
This lab had two major purposes, the first being to learn about ECG signals and the second was to learn about noise in biomedical signals. ECG signals, as previously stated, are probably the most important biomedical signal for a medical practitioner. It is a representation of the heartâ€™s movements due to electrical signals. However, like any other signal there will be the main signal, which is what we want, and this signal will have underlying noise. In this lab we explored different ways to deal with this noise. In the first part of the lab we explored cross correlation and synchronized averaging to smoothen the signal (aka remove noise). In the last part of the lab we explored different filters to reduce the noise. We specifically looked at the Butterworth and Chebyshev Type 1 IIR bandpass filters.
